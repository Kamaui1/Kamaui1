- 👋 Hi, I’m @Kamaui1
- 👀 I’m interested in learning skills that will help me to make a positive impact upon the world
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to code
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on learning, because coding is much more complex than it was in 1993 when I last did it
- 📫 How to reach me I can be reached via email at kanakafreedom@gmail.com
